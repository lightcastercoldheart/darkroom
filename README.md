### Messaging

Dark Room revolves around conversing with random strangers who are trapped with you <br>
While you are free to talk with them or role-play based on the characters that have been randomly assigned to you, <br>
you can also choose to solve riddles by listening to the story being narrated during the game. <br>
Solving the riddle unlocks certain elements within the 3D environment that can be controlled by saying a specific keyword.

#### Speech to Text

Dark Room uses Google's Speech to Text API to allow the translation of mic input into displayed text on screen. Instead of users hearing
other user's voice, they will be seeing it as translated text on displayed on the environment. Fade transitions will be applied and certain
words that relate to the keyword clue will be highlighted to aid users in solving the riddle within the timeframe.
